Description: This R package is a useful (though not totally coherent)
    collection of functions used for analyzing and visualizing 16S rRNA
    amplicon data. This package was created mainly for use in the Relman Lab
    at Stanford University (relman.stanford.edu). In addition, this package
    contains some functions that Dan has created for working with proteomics
    M/S data, or simply tools for visualizing data more effectively.
